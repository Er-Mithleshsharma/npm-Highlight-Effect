  text: "Nowadays, in some countries, parents believe that if kids try hard, they will achieve their goals. In the following paragraphs, I will explain the pros and cons. On one hand, encouraging younger generations can support their success. Supportive actions help them promote cooperative feelings, which are essential for long-term goals. Asking them to try harder can foster a sense of responsibility, boosting their mental well-being and self-esteem. For example, in the USA, parents sometimes monitor kids by buying gifts, allowing them to make mistakes and learn the best path. On the other hand, unrealistic goals can harm childrenâ€™s motivation if they cannot achieve them. Setting realistic targets is crucial to avoid damaging their mental health. Consulting a psychologist may help prevent depression. In India, some therapists emphasize choosing achievable goals for well-being. In conclusion, setting optimal and achievable targets is important for mental health and success.",
